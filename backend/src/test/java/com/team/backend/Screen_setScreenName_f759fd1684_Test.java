1. Scenario: Validate that the function setScreenName accepts a string as an input
   Test Steps: Pass a string as an argument to the function
   Expected Outcome: The function should accept the string and set it as the screenName without any error

2. Scenario: Validate that the function setScreenName does not accept null as an input
   Test Steps: Pass null as an argument to the function
   Expected Outcome: The function should throw an error or exception

3. Scenario: Validate that the function setScreenName handles empty string input
   Test Steps: Pass an empty string as an argument to the function
   Expected Outcome: The function should either accept the empty string and set it as the screenName or throw an error, depending on the business logic

4. Scenario: Validate that the function setScreenName handles string with special characters
   Test Steps: Pass a string with special characters as an argument to the function
   Expected Outcome: The function should either accept the string and set it as the screenName or throw an error, depending on the business logic

5. Scenario: Validate that the function setScreenName handles string with numbers
   Test Steps: Pass a string with numbers as an argument to the function
   Expected Outcome: The function should either accept the string and set it as the screenName or throw an error, depending on the business logic

6. Scenario: Validate that the function setScreenName handles string with spaces
   Test Steps: Pass a string with spaces as an argument to the function
   Expected Outcome: The function should either accept the string and set it as the screenName or throw an error, depending on the business logic

7. Scenario: Validate that the function setScreenName handles string with maximum length allowed
   Test Steps: Pass a string with maximum length allowed by the system as an argument to the function
   Expected Outcome: The function should either accept the string and set it as the screenName or throw an error, depending on the business logic

8. Scenario: Validate that the function setScreenName handles string longer than maximum length allowed
   Test Steps: Pass a string longer than maximum length allowed by the system as an argument to the function
   Expected Outcome: The function should throw an error or exception

9. Scenario: Validate that the function setScreenName handles string with minimum length allowed
   Test Steps: Pass a string with minimum length allowed by the system as an argument to the function
   Expected Outcome: The function should either accept the string and set it as the screenName or throw an error, depending on the business logic

10. Scenario: Validate that the function setScreenName handles string shorter than minimum length allowed
    Test Steps: Pass a string shorter than minimum length allowed by the system as an argument to the function
    Expected Outcome: The function should throw an error or exception.
