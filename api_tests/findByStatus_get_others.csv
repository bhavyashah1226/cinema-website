Given a set of instructions to create dummy CSV data for variable 'status', the CSV output without using double quotes, mixes data types and occasionally skips values, could look as follows:

status
available
899
pending
"closed"
463
sold
available
300
pending
65
"refund"
available
"returned item"
sold
77
pending
available
"suspended"
sold
"disposed"
899
